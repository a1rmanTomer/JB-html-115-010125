## **Home Assignment 1: Exploring HTML Tags**

### **Objective:**

Learn and practice the usage of the following HTML tags: `<div>`, `<img>`, `<p>`, `<span>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`.

### **Instructions:**

1. Create an HTML file named `assignment1.html`.
2. Use the following tags in your file:
   - A `<div>` that acts as a container for the entire content.
   - Add a `<h1>` tag for the main heading of the webpage (e.g., "My First HTML Page").
   - Add a `<h2>` tag for a subheading (e.g., "Introduction").
   - Add a `<h3>` tag for another subheading (e.g., "Details").
   - Use a `<p>` tag to add some descriptive text under each heading.
   - Insert an image (`<img>`) using a publicly accessible URL or a local image file.
   - Use a `<span>` tag to highlight a specific word or phrase in one of your paragraphs with inline styling (e.g., make it bold or change the color).

### **Requirements:**

- Ensure the HTML file is properly structured with a `<head>` and `<body>` section.
- Use descriptive text for your headings and paragraphs.
- Test your HTML file in a browser to confirm it renders correctly.

## **Home Assignment 2: Styling with External CSS**

### **Objective:**

Learn how to use external CSS to style your webpage using classes.

### **Instructions:**

1. Create an HTML file named `assignment2.html`.
2. Create a CSS file named `styles.css` and link it to your HTML file using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section.
3. In your HTML file:

   - Create a `<div>` container that holds all the content.
   - Add a `<h1>` tag for the title of your page.
   - Add an image using the `<img>` tag.
   - Write two paragraphs using the `<p>` tag.
   - Use a `<span>` inside one paragraph to emphasize a word.

4. In your CSS file (`styles.css`):

   - Create a class called `.container` and apply the following properties:
     - `border`: 2px solid black;
     - `margin`: 20px;
     - `padding`: 15px;
     - `width`: 80%;
   - Create a class called `.highlight` and apply the following properties:
     - `color`: red;
     - `font-weight`: bold;
   - Create a class called `.image` and apply the following properties:
     - `border`: 5px solid gray;
     - `width`: 300px;
     - `height`: 200px;
   - Apply a background color to the `<div>` and set the text color for `<h1>` using CSS.

5. Use the classes in your HTML file:
   - Apply the `.container` class to the `<div>` element.
   - Apply the `.highlight` class to the `<span>` element.
   - Apply the `.image` class to the `<img>` element.

### **Requirements:**

- Ensure your CSS file is properly linked to the HTML file.
- Test your HTML and CSS in a browser to confirm the styles are applied correctly.
- Use proper indentation and comments in both HTML and CSS files.
